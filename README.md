# 📚 Concepts

> Sharing is caring. Following is a collection of concepts which any maintainer needs to master in order to gracefully maintain this project and scale its implementation along with its unit, integration and end-to-end tests.

## 📗 Application Architecture

> Flux based application architecture is applied using `redux`, `react-redux`, `redux-thunk` and `redux-logger`.

> Actions and thunks are dispatched to mutate application state in store.
